        <div  id="tribute-info">
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>1918–1934</strong> Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in the village of Mvezo in Umtata,
              then part of South Africa's Cape Province.</li>
            <li> <strong>1934–1940</strong> ntending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the
              Thembu royal house, in 1933 Mandela began his secondary education at Clarkebury Methodist High School
              in Engcobo, a Western-style institution that was the largest school for black Africans in Thembuland.[25] </li>
            <li> <strong>1941–1943</strong>Returning to Mqhekezweni in December 1940, Mandela found that Jongintaba had arranged
              marriages for him and Justice; dismayed, they fled to Johannesburg via Queenstown, arriving in April 1941.
               Mandela found work as a night watchman at Crown Mines, his "first sight of South African capitalism in action", but was fired when the induna (headman) discovered that he was a runaway </li>
            <li> <strong>1943–1949</strong> Mandela began studying law at the University of the Witwatersrand,
              where he was the only black African student and faced racism. There, he befriended liberal and
              communist European, Jewish, and Indian students, among them Joe Slovo and Ruth First.
              Becoming increasingly politicised, in August 1943 Mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises.[53]  </li>
            <li> <strong>1950–1954</strong> Mandela took Xuma's place on the ANC national executive in March 1950,[71] and that same year was elected national
              president of the ANCYL. In March, the Defend Free Speech Convention was held in Johannesburg, bringing together African,
              Indian, and communist activists to call a May Day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. </li>
            <li> <strong>1955–1961</strong> After taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the Sophiatown suburb of Johannesburg in February 1955,
               Mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. </li>
            <li> <strong>1961–1962</strong>Disguised as a chauffeur, Mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the ANC's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike.
              Referred to as the "Black Pimpernel" in the press—a reference to Emma Orczy's 1905 novel The Scarlet Pimpernel—a warrant for his arrest was put out by the police. </li>
